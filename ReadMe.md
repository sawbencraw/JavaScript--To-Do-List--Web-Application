# Overview

As a software engineer seeking to expand my skills and deepen my understanding of JavaScript, I developed a to-do list application. This project aimed to demonstrate my proficiency in JavaScript language syntax and showcase my ability to create interactive web applications.

The to-do list software allows users to add, edit, delete, sort, and filter tasks dynamically. It incorporates features such as date and time manipulation, task prioritization, and responsive user interface design.

This application was created over the course of two weeks, having 1-2 hours spent daily actively researching necessary functionalities of JavaScript and HTML and then implementing what was learned into the program. In total, approximatly 18 hours were spent developing this app.

# Development Environment

For the development of this software, I used a combination of tools to streamline the process and enhance productivity. These tools include:

Code Editor: Visual Studio Code provided the necessary environment for writing, debugging, and managing the codebase efficiently.
Web Browser: Google Chrome served as the primary browser for testing and debugging the application's functionality.
Version Control: Git and GitHub facilitated version control, allowing for collaboration and easy tracking of code changes.
The software was created with both HTML and JavaScript, but focus for the project was on the JavaScript programming language, leveraging the following library:

Moment.js: Utilized for date and time manipulation, Moment.js simplified handling and formatting of dates within the application.

# Useful Websites

Throughout the development process, several websites proved to be invaluable resources for reference, documentation, and troubleshooting. These include:

Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Web Docs: MDN provided comprehensive documentation and guides for JavaScript language features and web development concepts.
Stack Overflow: Stack Overflow served as a valuable community-driven platform for seeking solutions to coding challenges and debugging issues.
W3Schools: W3Schools offered tutorials, references, and examples covering a wide range of web development topics for HTML and JavaScript.

# Future Work

While the current version of the to-do list application demonstrates core functionality, there are areas for improvement and additional features that could be implemented in the future. Some potential areas for future work include:

Implementing user authentication and data persistence to store tasks across sessions.
Enhancing the user interface with animations and transitions for a more engaging experience.
Adding support for task categories or tags to organize tasks effectively.
Implementing drag-and-drop functionality for task reordering.
Finalize filter system to allow for completed items to appear.
